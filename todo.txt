a = [1,2]
b = [2,3]
a = [1,2] + b
c = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
d = [[3],[4]]
e = c * d

1. make a dictionary of functions that the user can type in
3. make sure old functionality works
4. write unit tests
2. ref(e) -> run it in main

rref(e)
rank(e)
det(e)
inverse(e)
transpose(e)
null(e)
identity(int) -> returns identity matrix of int x int
